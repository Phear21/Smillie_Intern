## Overview
This project is a React application developed for the S,illie internship. It includes various components such as home, sidebar, navbar, company dropdown, and feature dropdown.

## The Challenge
The primary challenge I encountered during the development of the website was related to my familiarity and experience with Tailwind CSS. This project marks my second experience with Tailwind, and given that I haven't worked on frontend development for approximately two months, it took some time to reacquaint myself with the framework
